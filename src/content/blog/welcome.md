# We Have Evolved.

In 2021, we launched **SoPlugged** with a simple mission: to help Black-owned businesses get found. We built a directory, hosted pop-ups, and created a community that spanned from Halifax to Vancouver.

But as we watched our members grow, we realized that "being found" wasn't enough.

## The Kitchen Table CEO

We saw a specific type of founder emerging. You weren't just a "small business owner." You were a **Kitchen Table CEO**.
You were running a complex logistics operation, a marketing agency, and a customer support center—all from your laptop, often after your 9-5 or after putting the kids to bed.

You didn't need another networking mixer.
You needed **operational strategy**.
You needed **capital**.
You needed **clarity**.

## Enter Compound

**Compound Accelerator** is our answer to that need. We are no longer just a list of names. We are an engine for growth.

We have moved away from broad "support" to focused **acceleration**.
*   **The Barter Economy:** Preserving your cash flow.
*   **Digital Optimization:** Fixing your conversion rates.
*   **Real Talk:** Protecting your mental health.

We are here to help you turn that kitchen table hustle into a household name.

Welcome to the new era.
**Welcome to Compound.**
